In the class on January 29, 2024, I actively participated in a class activity focused on developing three distinct prototypes for the frontend user interface of my project. Following the creation of these prototypes, I shared them with my team members, who subsequently reviewed and ranked each design. The team provided valuable feedback, highlighting the pros and cons of each prototype.
